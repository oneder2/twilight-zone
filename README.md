This is my personal Game dev project via unity.


## Prompt to AI
I am developing a puzzle solving based on Unity2d.
This game is a horror game, referenced a famous horror game called "house", which is popular for its process and story designing.

The plot of my game is: The school is falling into hell, and you are currently located at limbo(which is believed as the boundary between reality and hell). Now you are supposed to kill all people in the scene, because that is the only way to rescure them back to real world, other wise that will suiside after been parasided by evil spirit after a few minute.

The game it self, does not happen in a narrow, dark envirounment, instead, it is in a school, in a bright scene in general.

Now, I have already finished, that is, you don't have to worry about how to set up:
1. tilemap system
2. basic player moving logic, including moving, running, stamina bar,
3. basic animation for player.
4. scene changing and teleporting
5. item designing, including check item, pick item, and player inventory design.
6. scene state saving, save status of item's interaction state, if has been picked up, and so on
7. basic NPC interaction system.
8. Game stage setting(That is to say, according to my ploting, after player kill a person, or failed to kill the person in time, game stage will change)
    a. Now, light will change based on time change, getting redder and darker
9. game event manager, to manage game events, which is mainlly been used as the manager of stage.
10. UI system, including stamia bar visualize, diagogue bar 
And some detail bug fixxing.

Next, I want to realize:
1. special effect coodinate with game (visual effect, sound effect)
2. more complex npc interaction, and more complex npc moving logic ()
3. time sensative NPC changement & puzzle
4. envirounment change wihtin stage process
5. result & consequence of failure
6. limit enmey generation to outer scene boundary
7. after enter dead state, player different animation.
8. inventory UI
