# Twilight Zone: A Unity2D Horror Puzzle Game

Welcome to Twilight Zone, a personal game development project built using Unity2D. This is a horror-themed puzzle-solving game inspired by the famous horror game "House", known for its engaging process and story design. Dive into a chilling yet bright school environment where moral dilemmas and survival intertwine.

## About the Game
In Hellbound School, the school you once knew is descending into hell, and you find yourself trapped in Limbo—the eerie boundary between reality and the abyss. The plot revolves around a grim mission: to "rescue" everyone in the scene, you must kill them before they succumb to possession by evil spirits, which leads to their suicide within minutes. Unlike traditional horror games set in dark, confined spaces, this game unfolds in a brightly lit school environment, creating a unique contrast to its dark narrative.

## Current Features
The game is already functional with the following core systems implemented:

1. Tilemap System: A fully operational tile-based environment for the school setting.

2. Player Movement:
    - Basic movement and running mechanics.
    - Stamina bar system to limit sprinting.
    - Player animations for various actions.

3. Scene Management:
    - Scene transitions and teleportation mechanics.
    - Scene state saving (e.g., item interaction states, picked-up items).

4. Item System:
    - Item inspection and collection.
    - Player inventory management.
5. NPC Interaction: Basic NPC dialogue and interaction system.
6. Game Stages:
7. Dynamic stage progression tied to the plot (e.g., killing an NPC or failing to do so advances the stage).
8. Lighting changes over time—becoming redder and darker as hell encroaches.
9. Event Manager: A centralized system to handle game events and stage transitions.
10. UI System:
    - Stamina bar visualization.
    - Dialogue bar for NPC interactions.
11. Bug Fixes: Various minor tweaks and polish for stability.
12. Inventory UI: A polished interface for managing collected items.

## Planned Features
The next phase of development will focus on enhancing immersion and complexity:

1. Special Effects:
    - Visual effects (e.g., eerie distortions, blood splatters).
    - Sound effects to heighten tension and atmosphere.
2. Advanced NPC Behavior:
    - More complex interactions and dialogue trees.
    - Dynamic NPC movement logic.
3. Time-Sensitive Mechanics:
4. NPCs evolve or degrade based on time (e.g., possession progression).
5. Time-based puzzles to increase challenge.
6. Environmental Changes: Dynamic shifts in the school environment as stages progress.
7. Failure Consequences: Meaningful outcomes for failing to save/kill NPCs in time.
8. Enemy Spawning: Limit enemy generation to outer scene boundaries for balance.
9. Death State: Unique player animations and effects upon entering a "dead" state.
